### ⚠️ Note on "Production Failed ❌" in GitHub

- That **cross sign** appears when GitHub shows a **linting/build preview failure** for Markdown or README rendering.  
- **It does NOT affect your deployed Firebase site.**  
- Common reasons:
  1. Unclosed HTML tags in README.
  2. Wrong relative paths for images.
  3. Syntax issues in code blocks or Markdown.

✅ Using proper `<img>` tags with correct relative paths (like `./assets/imagename.jpg`) usually fixes this.
